## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of the project up and running.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed on your system. You will also need `pip` for package management.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    We recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts.
    ```sh
    # Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

    # Install dependencies
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    > **Note:** A `requirements.txt` file should be created containing necessary libraries like `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-image`.
